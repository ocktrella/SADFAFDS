1. Say "Sam's God"
2. Install MYSQL
3. Create a sql database. 
3. Run the tables.sql file (located in the initalize folder) in the database you create. This creates the sql tables needed to keep track of user balances and investments.
4. Edit the config.php file, and the api/config.php file. Replace 

```
$servername = "Put your own host here";
$serverusername = "Put your own user here";
$serverDatabase = "Put your own database here";
$serverpassword = "Put your own password here";
```

with your own MYSQL username and password
